# 🦅 GARAGE OF GARUDA - SolidWorks Practice Files 🛠️   
> *Because every design starts with a sketch… and ends with 37 rebuild errors.*

Welcome to my personal **SolidWorks jungle**, where sketches roam free, constraints are optional, and assemblies are held together with faith, friction, and a touch of caffeine-fueled desperation.

---

## 🤔 What is this?

This is my **SolidWorks practice repo**, where:

- 🤖 Robots begin their humble digital lives  
- 🧱 Parts get designed, broken, redesigned, then forgotten  
- ⚙️ Assemblies break apart faster than group projects  
- 📉 Simulations remind me that gravity is undefeated

## 📁 What's Inside?
| File Type   | Description                          |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| `.SLDPRT`   | Bold attempts at modeling something useful  
| `.SLDASM`   | Collection of regrets & accidental mates  
| `.SLDDRW`   | Technical drawings that look serious  
| `.JPG/PNG`  | Screenshots before it all fell apart

---

## 🧪 Skills I'm Building (Or Trying To):

- ✅ Sketching with *just enough* constraints  
- ✅ Making parts that resemble actual objects  
- ✅ Assembling components like a mechanical therapist  
- ✅ Simulating motion (and unexpected explosions)

---

## 🤯 Real Engineering Challenges Faced:

- Why won’t this mate? WHY?  
- Accidentally made a screw 12 meters long  
- Forgetting to save before “that one fillet”  
- Fully defined? Great. Rebuild error? Still there.  
- Crashed SolidWorks > reopened > crashed again  

---

## 🦾 Future Projects:
- RoboWar weapon systems (that don’t destroy themselves)  
- Line followers that follow *something*  
- 3D-printed chaos disguised as innovation  
- PCB casings that actually fit the PCB (for once)

---

## 🚀 Why Upload to GitHub?

Because:
- I believe in **version control**, not just *Ctrl+Z*  
- My PC deserves cloud backup before it melts  
- Someone, somewhere, might learn (or laugh)

## ✨ How You Can Help:

- ⭐ Star this repo if you’ve ever misaligned an extrusion  
- 🛠️ Fork it if you want to join the design circus  
- 🧠 Submit issues if you spot cursed geometry  
- 📨 DM me if you wanna collab on cool stuff

– A future me, probably.

Thanks for scrolling this far. Now go build something amazing… or at least symmetrical.

✨ Star this repo if you’ve ever yelled “WHY DID YOU REBUILD LIKE THAT?” at your screen.
